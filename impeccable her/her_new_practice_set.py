For example, if the function is passed 6 and 4, it should return 24.'''

#q4
'''8. Give me the discount
Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first should be the full price of an item as an integer. 
The second should be the discount percentage as an integer.

 For example, if the price is 100 and the discount is 20, the function should return 80.'''

#q5

'''Repeat the characters
Create a Python function that accepts a string. The function should return a string, 
with each character in the original string doubled. 
If you send the function “now” as a parameter, 
it should return “nnooww,” and if you send “123a!”, it should return “112233aa!!”.'''
